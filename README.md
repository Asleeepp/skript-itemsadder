# skript-itemsadder

### Archiving

This addon has been archived as I no longer feel the spark to continue to work on this addon, especially now that I am starting to move away, (and basically have entirely moved away) from Skript myself, and the fact that I no longer even use the plugin that this addon is based around (ItemsAdder), This started off as just an addon that would connect some ItemsAdder stuff to skript syntax for easy use instead of messing with skript-reflect shenanigans, personal use, I then released it in case anyone wanted to use it for themselves, as the built in Skript API for ItemsAdder was quite bare bones.

Thank you for the great learning experience skript-itemsadder ðŸ«¡

skript-itemsadder, an addon to replace the existing, but lackluster Skript API ItemsAdder has. (2 expressions and 1 condition)

skript-itemsadder more then septuples the amount of features then that Skript API!
